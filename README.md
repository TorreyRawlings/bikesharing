#### The purpose of this analysis is to provide data for investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business plan. In our tableau link (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/torrey.rawlings/viz/NYCItyBikeShareAnalysis/Story1) you'll be able to see charts on the following data: 

    - Checkout Times for Users
        - This shows for any hour of the day how many bikes were checked out. This has a filter added so you can select which hours of the day you'd like to preview. Keep in mind this is in military time so to determine what each number is for each hour see below: 
            - 0 = 12 AM
            - 1 = 1 AM
            - 2 = 2 AM
            - 3 = 3 AM
            - 4 = 4 AM
            - 5 = 5 AM
            - 6 = 6 AM
            - 7 = 7 AM
            - 8 = 8 AM
            - 9 = 9 AM
            - 10 = 10 AM
            - 11 = 11 AM
            - 12 = 12 AM
            - 13 = 1 PM
            - 14 = 2 PM
            - 15 = 3 PM
            - 16 = 4 PM
            - 17 = 5 PM
            - 18 = 6 PM
            - 19 = 7 PM
            - 20 = 8 PM
            - 21 = 9 PM
            - 22 = 10 PM
            - 23 = 11 PM
    - Checkout Times by Gender
        - This shows simliar data as above but by gender. The time format will be the same as above. One noticable thing you can see here is men are much more likely to borrow a bike in the early hours than women. Then again it also looks like overall there are just more male riders in general.
    - Trips by Weekday per Hour
        - This is a heatmap to show the amount of users by hour in a differnt format. Here it looks like Thursday at 6pm is the most popular.
    - Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
        - Another heatmap to show the amount of users by hour for each day of the week. It seems despite the gender the most popular times are pretty simliar for day/hour.
    - User Trips by Gender by Weekday
        - This heatmap shows a few differnt things. It shows the amount of users on weekdays/ by gender/ and by user type. You can see that subscribers seem to be using bike sharing much more often except for in the case of unkown in which it looks like those that do not input their gender are just normal customers. 
    - Top Staring Locations
        - This shows some of the most popular starting locations that people are renting their bike from on a color based map. Here we have the dots showing larger and darker the more popular the area.
    - Top Ending Locations
        - This map, similiar to above, uses color and size to show the most popular ending locations for those renting a bike.

#### Summary: 
    In Summary it looks like men are more typical users for bike sharing and between 5-7 PM is the most popular times to rent a bike. I think 2 more graphs that would be helpful would be to see maps of the most popular locations for starting and ending by the weekday. This way we know where to supply more bikes on specific days to the starting locations and whether the ending locations are going back to the starting locations or if perhaps athere should be a extra charge if the bike isnt dropped off in a specific location or a discount if it's dropped off in a more popular location.
